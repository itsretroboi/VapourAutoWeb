	<h1>FAQ's & Commonly Asked Questions</h1>
	<main>
		<details>
			<summary>What is vapour detailing and why is it better?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>Vapour is a moist gas that heats to loosen and lift dirt, grease and salt. It not only cleans but
					sanitizes any surface that it touches. It is a ECO-friendly alternative to other methods and can be
					used without the use of any chemicals. While a traditional detailing shop will use 90-100 of liters
					of water per car - vapour detailing only requires 5-10 liters.</p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>Will vapour detailing damage my car exterior?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>No. Vapour is safe and gentle for all car surfaces and finishes. If used correctly, washing a vehicle
					with steam and microfibers will not create micro-scratches (swirl marks). the tip of the spray gun
					is held 10-15 cm away from the surface of the vehicle. At this distance the steam temperature is
					below 65~85℃ and will not cause damage to the vehicle’s body paint. Steam vapour quickly and gently
					loosens caked-on dirt and grime. As steam is applied at a 30 degree angle (away from the operator),
					loosened dirt and grime will be sprayed away. Then the operator follows the steam trail with a
					microfiber towel to absorb moisture residue.</p>
			</div>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Is vapour safe on leather vinyl and upholstery?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>Yes! Vapour is safe and gentle for all car surfaces and finishes. The temperature, pressure and steam
					content are precisely controlled to do thorough cleaning work without affecting interiors &
					exteriors or other car surfaces. On leather, steam works well by lifting dirt that has settled into
					micro cracks and crevices. Vapour removes stains and odors from upholstery in less time and using
					less water than a cold water carpet extractor. Using steam, interiors are dry within minutes!</p>
			</div>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>What parts of the vehicle cannot be cleaned with vapour?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>We do not use steam on radios, speakers, dash board displays or exposed electrical components. During
					engine bay details all sensitive components are covered and protected from any water overspray.</p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>Will my vehicle interior be wet after detailing?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>In most cases your seats will be moist and not wet. For heavier seat stains more steam is used
					however the drying time is still much less than traditional extraction methods . Using system we are
					able to regulate the moisture level of the steam for different types of stains and surfaces. </p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>What methods do you use to remove salt from carpets?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>Our steamers are able to pump out "wet" vapour that is 80-90% water. This ammount of moisture and
					heat instantly melts down salt and it is instantly vacuumed out of the carpet. Other detailing shops
					use kettles of water and brushes that push almost all of the salt into the undercarriage without the
					customers knowledge. This will eventually rust and rot out the floor boards underneath the carpet.
					With steam the salt and waste water are instantly picked up with the vacuum ensuring no water is
					caught in the undercarriage.</p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>What types of supplies and equipment do you use?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>We use professional grade waxes polishes and ceramic coatings. Our cleaners are formulated to clean
					your car without damaging your interior or exterior in any way.
					Our trained detail technicians use only the finest & highest quality supplies & “state of the art”
					equipment.</p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>What is a ceramic coating and how does it work?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>Ceramic coatings work by bonding a thin layer of product directly to your car’s paintwork creating a
					new substrate. Once bonded the product is much harder to remove than traditional products and is,
					therefore, more durable. Unlike wax or sealant these coatings last upwards of 3 years to provide
					excellent UV & heat protection as well as adding a super hydrophobic properties to the paint.
					Depending on the coating used they are suitable for use on paintwork, wheels, glass and plastic
					trim.

					The basic chemical composition of a ceramic coating is Silicon Dioxide (SiO2). Ceramic coatings may
					also be referred to as quartz or glass coatings.</p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>What kind of maintenance is required for ceramic coatings?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>Despite being very durable they coatings maintenance is still required to ensure preformance for a
					long period of time. Beware of the hype that comes with many car treatment systems (ceramic and
					dealership applied treatments) that promise ‘no polishing’ and ‘lifetime protection with no
					maintenance as part of the deal.

					We have worked on countless vehicles with various coating systems applied and have yet to find any
					that meet the often extravagant claims made by the industry. It is simply not possible to coat a
					car, then treat it to the occasional wash, and for it to remain glossy and contaminant free several
					years down the road.

					We advise "refill" appointments for our customers every 12 months. This is to reintroduce ceramic
					back into vehicles paint by thoroughly decontaminating and the removal of any road tar, iron, tree
					sap and industrial fallout deposits that may have accumulated. Following that we will apply an SIO2
					sealant to rejuvenate the ceramic coating and enhance its hydrophobic properties. If not done
					annually the coating will degrade and properties will begin to detererate.</p>
			</div>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>I’ve had my car treated, whats next?</summary>
			<div class="faq__content">
				<p>Avoid roller brush car washes and wiping your car clean when it’s dry. Always use PH neutral shampoo
					and a very soft microfiber wash mitts (or steam) to detail the vehicle. Since the coating repells
					most contaminants its extremely easy to keep clean.</p>
