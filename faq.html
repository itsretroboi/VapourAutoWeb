	  <summary>What is vapour detailing and why is it better?</summary>
	  <div class="faq__content">
		<p>Vapour is a  moist gas that heats to loosen and lift dirt, grease and salt. It not only  cleans but sanitizes any surface that it touches. It is a ECO-friendly alternative to other methods and can be used without the use of any chemicals. While a traditional detailing shop will use 90-100 of liters of water per car - vapour detailing only requires 5-10 liters.</p>

	  <summary>Will vapour detailing damage my car exterior?</summary>
	  <div class="faq__content">
		<p>No. Vapour is safe and gentle for all car surfaces and finishes. If used correctly, washing a vehicle with steam and microfibers will not create micro-scratches (swirl marks). the tip of the spray gun is held 10-15 cm away from the surface of the vehicle. At this distance the steam temperature is below 65~85℃ and will not cause damage to the vehicle’s body paint. Steam vapour quickly and gently loosens caked-on dirt and grime. As steam is applied at a 30 degree angle (away from the operator), loosened dirt and grime will be sprayed away. Then the operator follows the steam trail with a microfiber towel to absorb moisture residue.</p>
